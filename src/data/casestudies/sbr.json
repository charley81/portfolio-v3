I crafted a problem statement and hypothesis statements for both DJs and fans, outlining how centralized streaming, profile management, and interactive features could enhance their experiences.

This led to key \"How Might We\" questions, such as improving speed and providing a personalized experience, which guided our focus on streamlining the user flow and reducing steps in the ordering process. These insights drove our design improvements to create a more efficient, user-friendly app."
